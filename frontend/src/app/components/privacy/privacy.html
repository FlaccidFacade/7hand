      <h2>Personalized Advertising</h2>
      <p>
        We may display personalized ads based on your interests and browsing behavior. These ads are delivered through 
        our advertising partners, including Google AdSense.
      </p>
      <h3>How Personalized Ads Work</h3>
      <p>
        Personalized advertising uses information about your activities across websites and apps to show you ads that 
        are more relevant to your interests. This includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Websites you visit</li>
        <li>Apps you use</li>
        <li>Content you interact with</li>
        <li>Your approximate location</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Opting Out of Personalized Ads</h3>
      <p>
        You can control personalized advertising by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visiting Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ad Settings</a></li>
        <li>Using the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DAA's WebChoices Tool</a></li>
        <li>Using the <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EDAA's opt-out page</a> (for users in Europe)</li>
        <li>Adjusting your device settings to limit ad tracking (iOS or Android)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Please note that opting out of personalized advertising does not mean you will no longer see ads, 
        but the ads you see will be less relevant to your interests.
